# RR2023_projectgroup
This a repository for RR group project. Members are Ida Supeł, Weronika Motkowska and Magdalena Kowalewska. The project details are to be described in README by 5th of May.

The task is as follows:

1. Take an econometric / statistical analysis (e.g. from your bachelor thesis or Kaggle):
 
2. Translate the codes to a different programming language (e.g. R to Python or Stata to R, etc.)*
Reproduce the results.

3. Pick a way to improve the study or update the data** or perform a robustness check and do it.

4. Discuss the findings, potential problems, inconsistencies and conclusions.
*you should try exploiting the advantages and functions of the ‘new’ language
**data update can include: collecting new survey data (not many), using newer datasets, etc.

The analysis that we will choose will be specified until 5th of May. Initially we want to focus on transcribing to R.
